            I pursued my degree in physics at the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo (UFES), driven by a dream to become a researcher. However, it wasn't until I took a programming course that I discovered my true passion for IT. I was immediately captivated and knew that this was the field I wanted to pursue. Since then, I have been continuously learning and honing my skills, driven by a deep curiosity and desire to stay at the forefront of this dynamic and constantly evolving industry.
