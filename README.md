# Portfolio

Welcome to my online portfolio! This single-page application is created using React.js and Bootstrap, where I showcase my skills, education, and experience.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this GitHub project into a directory of your choice using the following command:

```shell
cd "directory of your choice"
git clone https://github.com/Fernando9200/Portfolio.git
```
## Development

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. To start development, navigate to the project directory and use the following command:

```shell
cd Portfolio
npm start
```

This will start a development server and open the application in your default browser. Any changes made to the code will automatically reload the page.

## Deployment

To deploy your application, run the following command in the project directory:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will create a build folder with your application code, which can be deployed to any static hosting service of your choice.
